# NVGT Utilities

This repository contains NVGT scripts I've made that I've decided to publish. A list of scripts, along with a brief description of what they do, is provided below.

## Audioutils

I was fed up with NVGT not currently having a way to synthesize sounds, so I made this script to remedy that. You can synthesize all four basic waveforms (sine, pulse, triangle and sawtooth), as well as binary white noise with adjustable density. The audio can be further manipulated with operator overloads and other methods. See the source code for complete documentation
